Front End

This was a project for me while I had downtime over the holidays. The idea behind this program is to sort numbers swapping the smallest number to the lowest index in the array. Next it would swap the second lowest number into the second lowest array index, and so forth. Then I wanted a delay on it so you can watch the change happen.

This reminded me of the bubble sort but much different logic when it comes to coding. This was quite a project for me and took many weeks of struggling through it. However I only worked on it when my homework was completed for the week, so it took awhile.
